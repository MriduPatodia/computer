This is all because of you and your presence every time we enter. I can't imagine it without you. All the wonderful conversations we had and the memories we shared will forever be cherished by all of us. The way you encourage all of us to do our best and constantly keep reminding me to study hard enough to get a gp is something I've never experienced before. It is a really heartwarming feeling and I will miss it with all my heart. The way I missed school the most on days I didn't have computer says it allüòÇ.

Like okay‚Äîmaybe things will be fine. I felt like I didn't have much to worry about (except catching up on the syllabus, obviously), but even that felt more manageable because it was you.\n\nAnd now, even though you've only taught us for a year, it feels like we've learned so much more than just the subject. Your classes became something I genuinely looked forward to. On the days when we were all fed up with chemistry, we'd check the timetable and go, "Abhi next E4 hai?" and then, "Thank god." Because, well‚Äîchemistry.\n\nHonestly, the computer lab started to feel like home. My friends keep telling me, "At this point tum lab mein ghar basa lo," and "I will come and physically drag you out of there." And I'd still choose to stay back every lunch break.\n\nI took up computer just for the subject, but with you, it wasn't just any elective. You made it feel like a safe little corner in the middle of all the chaos. You explained things in a way that made sense, but more than that, you got us. You looked out for us. And even when you didn't say much, you were still there in a way that really mattered.\n\nIt's hard to put into words how much it hurts that you're leaving because you made a difference‚Äîand that doesn't just go away.\n\nThank you. For the calm. For the care. For everything.\n\nI'll try my best to get that 100. Promise.\n\nI'm going to miss you so, so much.

                message: "Dear Ms. Gulati,\n\nI still remember walking into your class thinking computers were just boxes of blinking lights and confusing code‚Äîsomething I'd tolerate, not love. But somehow, through your magical ability to explain things that would normally make my brain melt, you turned that confusion into curiosity, and that curiosity into passion. Now I can confidently say: you've made me fall in love with computers. (Which, to be honest, is great... until I spend hours debugging a semicolon error and silently get irritated for being in this mess.)\n\nBut beyond the bits and bytes, you've taught me lessons that aren't found in any textbook. You taught me resilience‚Äîbecause every crash and every failed code attempt was a chance to try again. You taught me patience‚Äîespecially when I watched you repeat the same explanation five times, still smiling, while we all stared at you like stunned goldfish. And most of all, you taught me to believe in myself, even when I didn't. That's the kind of teacher you are: the kind who doesn't just teach the subject but shapes the student.\n\nYou were never just a teacher. You were a mentor, a counselor, a debugger of both code and life problems. You supported me when I was stuck, encouraged me when I wanted to give up, and celebrated the small wins with a pride that felt like family. Honestly, if there were a patch update for 'Perfect Human,' I think you'd already be running the latest version.\n\nIt's hard to imagine the school without your presence‚Äîthe sound of your laughter, and the warmth you brought into the lab. We'll miss your lessons, your wisdom.\n\nThank you for everything, truly. You've not only made an impact on my education but on who I'm becoming as a person. Wherever you're heading next, they're ridiculously lucky to have you.\n\nWishing you endless happiness and new adventures.\n\nWith love && immense gratitude\n\n-Aadyaa ‚ù§Ô∏è"
